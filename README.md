### Thessaloniki Ruby Meetup (thessrb)

thess.rb is a group of (not just) geeks, who love Ruby (among other things),
live (not just) in Thessaloniki (Greece), and meet at least once a month to
throw some presentations (sometimes) and have beers (every time).

### Meetups

We have at least one meetup every month. Here are some ways to find out when the
next meetup will be:

* Become a member here http://www.meetup.com/thessrb/

* Visit http://git.io/thessrb and click "Watch" to start receiving notifications
  in your personal GitHub account. Whenever we announce a new meetup we create a
  pull request that has all the details.

* Follow some core members on Twitter
